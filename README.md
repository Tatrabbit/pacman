# stupid pac-man clone.

## what.
I'm learning to work with SDL, with an emphasis on scalability. I want to scale it up to my own engine, a sidescroller I've always wanted.

## why.
I want to make/finish Nipio's Adventure, a small piece of large bloatware that skyrocketed in scope creep when I was a young adult. Using Godot would come closest to how it originally felt like to play, but if I don't use C++, it won't really fulfill its artistic purpose. I need to close that chapter of my life and complete what I started then. It was originally written in Allegro 4 with TileStudio for map editing, and blew up into an egregious playground of project mismanagement. By the time I decided to stop, it was capable of general-purpose game dev with live editing via Lua (while the game was running, no less), and had HTML rendering capabilities... and worse.

## dedicating this garbage to two pupils.
* A very longime friend I met on some furry site, whose recent desire to learn Allegro 5 got me thinking about once again continuing that Nipio game he once did music for, long ago.
* A fairly recent friend I met on a YTP server, whose interest in linux and C programming reminds me of my own when I was their age.

these two know who they are.
